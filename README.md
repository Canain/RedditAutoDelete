A script to delete everything in your reddit profile page

To use it, just go to your profile page while logged in, and paste the script in using your favorite developer console.

I recommend using res and expanding all of your history if you want to delete everything.

This does not ever access your login information and should delete your comments as if you were actually manually deleting them.
